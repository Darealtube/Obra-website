# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to the OFFICIAL repository for our project!

I deleted the previous one because I've *kinda* messed it up a bit. But through hours and hours of

trying to solve the problem, I've done it!

## Notes

The project is going to be made with Typescript. Don't worry if you don't know it, just send some JS

files and I'm going to convert it to Typescript. It will also serve as a practice for me.

This project's CSS contains React-bootstrap and Font Awesome, so make sure to learn them.


Also, learn how to do Github because that's how you'll be able to contribute to this repo project.
