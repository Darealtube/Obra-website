# Thank You

After 8 months of development, Obra has finally reached it to the point that it can be released as a functional website. It may not be enterprise level, 
but it was what we hoped it would be. I may have worked alone on coding, but the help that I get from my friends who tested the website and gave their opinion
and improvements were a big reason why Obra grew this much. Without them, I wouldn't have thought about the problems they see that I can't.

These past 8 months of development have given me experience on different aspects of programming; On how to manage the database;
On how to make faster APIs; How to make a better design; Yet there is much more that I still have to know. Internationalization, better caching, faster performing APIs, 
Data management, so on and so forth.

This website, just as it grew every single day with development, has helped me grow as a programmer as well. I am on a road of making yet another big significant project but this time, I am not alone and there are even more new things that I will be able to learn while developing it. These 8 months have truly been a fun ride and will mark as my very first
big project, but definitely not the last.

For now I bid farewell to Obra, but I will definitely return as a better programmer.
